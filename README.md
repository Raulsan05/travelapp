## Project structure 

This Compose Multiplatform project includes three modules:

### [`composeApp`](/shared)
This is a Kotlin module that contains the common UI/logic for both Android and iOS applications, the code you share between platforms.
This shared module is also where you write your Compose Multiplatform code. In `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt`, you can find the shared root `@Composable` function for your app.
It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings in `composeApp/build.gradle.kts`. The shared module builds into an Android library and an iOS framework.

### [`androidApp`](/androidApp)
This is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system. The `androidApp` module depends on and uses the shared module as a regular Android library.

### [`iosApp`](/iosApp)
This is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application. It depends on and uses the shared module as a CocoaPods dependency.


## Setting up project üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

- Refer to the ***"Setting up environment"*** section of [this repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-ios-android-template/main/README.md) 
for knowing the setup guidelines
- After validating requirements as per the above guide, clone this repository.
- Open this project in Android Studio Electric Eel or newer version.
- Build project üî® and see if everything is working fine.
- Run App
  - Select "androidApp" as run configuration and you'll be able to run the Android app.
  - Select "iosApp" as run configuration and you'll be able to run the iOS app _(XCode can also be used to run the app)_.
